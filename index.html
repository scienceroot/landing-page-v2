        The first blockchain-based scientific ecosystem to integrate a Social Media Scientific Network, Funding Platform and
         Decentralized Publishing Mechanism.

        It will cover all the required functionalities during the scientific discovery process.

              Our goal is to create an ecosystem where anyone in the scientific community around the globe will have the 
              ability <br> to gather funding, interact, discuss research ideas, collaborate and in the end, publish their work
               through a more efficient, intuitive and transparent platform.

            <h2>Why Scienceroot?</h2>
            <h3>The current system of attaining funding, collaboration, and publishing findings is outdated and inefficient. 
              Scienceroot aims to leverage the decentralizing power of blockchain technology and incentivizing power of 
              cryptoeconomics to solve the biggest problems with the status quo.

            <h2>Challenges in the scientific landscape</h2>
            <ul>
              <li><i class="ion-android-checkmark-circle"></i>
                Limited access to research output. Knowledge is controlled by centralized companies and scientific discoveries
                 are kept behind paywalls.
              </li>
              <li><i class="ion-android-checkmark-circle"></i> 
                No rewards for the authors or reviewers.
              </li>
              <li><i class="ion-android-checkmark-circle"></i> 
                Reproducibility crisis. Results confirming established information are rarely published, increasing thus the 
                concern over the reliability of the scientific reports.
              </li>
              <li><i class="ion-android-checkmark-circle"></i>
                Wrong incentives; where you publish has become more important than the actual publication itself

              <li><i class="ion-android-checkmark-circle"></i>
                Only successful results are published. Even though failure is a necessary part of making progress, null 
                hypotheses and negative results are rarely shared within the scientific community.
              </li>
              <li><i class="ion-android-checkmark-circle"></i>
                Fractured platforms only addressing limited needs within the scientific community.

                  It will be like a Github for Science where you can fork the ideas from other researchers and continue to 
                  work on them without having to worry about identity theft.

                  are released and when they will be available. International Grants will be far more easily to be awarded and

                Reviewers are the key to checking and confirming the validity of the published scientific papers. We value the 
                work of the referees and that is why a percentage of the submission fee will be redirected to incentivize them.
                 This way, we will not only speed up the reviewing process, but also improve the quality of the publications.
                 Every half a year we will be ranking the top cited articles and the authors will be rewarded accordingly from 
                 the Scienceroot Fund. Readers will also be able to reward authors if they find the articles useful.

                A huge desire exists within the community to approach science with greater transparency and openness. As such, 
                Scienceroot builds its ecosystem on the blockchain to allow for truthful and public records.

                Companies are distributing their resources in a centralized fashion, shutting off content behind paywalls. 
                Utilizing underlying blockchain technology, we create a robust platform immune to censorship and fake

                The purpose of Scienceroot will be solely to promote and sustain science and research, with the help of 
                blockchain. We welcome new companies which want to adopt blockchain into their platforms and will have the 
                possibility to do this within our ecosystem. For example, already existing journals will have the possibility 
                to integrate our decentralized publishing framework into their existing business. The only requirement for 
                future partners will be to publish the content open access.

                Blockchain allows Scienceroot to provide its users with scientific workspaces with built-in immutability and
